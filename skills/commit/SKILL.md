# Commit — the durable checkpoint marker

Core principle: one commit per completed phase/item. The commit is what the loop resumes from and what the
handoff relies on, so its message is machine-readable loop state, not just prose.

## When
After `document`, per completed phase/item.

## Inputs
- the completed item's staged changes
- the `plan` / backlog item it traces back to (for the id) and any `issue` it resolves (for `github_ref`).

## Workflow
1. Stage the item's changes.
2. **Secret-scan the staged diff first.** Look for key prefixes, private-key headers, and
   `password` / `secret` / `api_key` / `token` set to a real (non-placeholder) literal. On a hit, **stop and
   escalate** — never commit the secret; once in history it lives there forever. (A guard hook re-checks this
   deterministically as the backstop — the step keeps it visible in the loop.)
3. **Run the mechanical gate.** Run the project's check runner (`.workflow/checks.sh --fix`) — it reformats,
   applies lint fixes, and strips a stale reference: the zero-judgment fixes a script can make safely. Re-stage
   and re-run in check mode. **Log what it fixed** (in the commit body or the `changelog`) — never silently
   mask a bad generator. Drift a script *cannot* safely fix — a stale/contradictory/over-claimed doc, a missing
   owner, a symbol a doc still names that the code renamed — is **not** resolved here: file a `create-issue`
   ticket with the evidence and the affected element's `commitment`, `severity` set from it (a locked
   contradiction rides high; cosmetic drift sits low as `debt`), and let the commit proceed.
4. **Split out a prerequisite-repair, if any.** If the `changelog` recorded a `prerequisite-repair`
   divergence, commit that repair as its **own** commit first — typed and scanned like any other — so the
   stumbled-into fix stays reviewable and revertible apart from the planned change.
5. Write the planned change as a **Conventional Commit** — `type(scope): summary`, type from the item's `kind`
   (`bug → fix`, `feature → feat`, `debt → refactor`/`chore`).
6. Add linking trailers:
   - `Refs: item #<backlog-id>` — always.
   - `Closes: #<github-issue>` — when this item resolves a tracked issue.

## Rules
- One commit for the item's planned change; a recorded `prerequisite-repair` rides its **own** preceding
  commit (the only split). Never bundle otherwise-unrelated items.
- The message must trace back to the item — no bare "wip"/"fix" subjects.
- The mechanical gate auto-fixes only zero-judgment issues; it **never decides which side of a doc↔code
  contradiction is right** — that authority call is deferred to the loop (the filed ticket routes through
  `prioritize` → planning). The installed git pre-commit hook re-runs the same check as the
  outside-the-loop backstop.
- Bookkeeping rides the **planned** commit: the backlog item's done-flip and the `handoff.md` rewrite happen
  **before** it (after any prerequisite-repair commit), so the completing commit captures them. `close-issue`
  is the only post-commit tail step.

## Output
A commit — the checkpoint marker. Its `Closes:` trailer names the issue that `close-issue` then closes.

## Route
→ `close-issue` (close the GitHub issue this item resolved), then the loop picks the next item.

## Calls
`create-issue` — when the mechanical gate surfaces semantic drift a script can't safely fix.

## References
Remote push and the branch lifecycle (the parallel-work merge/conflict extension) sit beyond this skill.
Commit is local and autonomous; **push is an outward action — gated behind explicit human permission** (the
loop keeps committing and queues the push for approval).
