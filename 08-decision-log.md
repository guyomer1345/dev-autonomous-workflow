# 08 — Decision Log (provenance)

Every decision from the planning conversation: the call, why, what was rejected, and the evidence.
This folder is the source of truth and supersedes prior-session memory where they conflict.

## D1 — This spec folder is the source of truth **[DECIDED]**
The decisions captured here (originally from the planning conversation) supersede prior-session memory /
architecture notes where they conflict; prior memory is background, re-verified here. *Evidence:* user
instruction.

## D2 — Build shape: pure Claude-Code-native config package **[DECIDED]**
Skills + subagents + hooks + slash commands + MCP + CLAUDE.md, run locally on the user's own
subscription. NOT a program that drives Claude.
*Rejected:* own-loop-on-raw-API; headless cockpit + website + watchdog that drives Claude (both sit in
the request path).
*Evidence:* master rule (D3); GSD / Spec Kit precedent (config packages, ~64k / 112k stars).

## D3 — Master rule: never in Claude's request path **[DECIDED]**
Everything local; components talk via local bus + files, never by routing Claude. A hosted router on
behalf of users = prohibited.
*Evidence:* Anthropic ToS posture (third-party routing banned); carried from prior analysis, reaffirmed.

## D4 — Agents persist (correction) **[DECIDED]**
Agents hold context and are re-messageable (SendMessage); not one-shot/stateless → three-layer memory
model; orchestrator stays a thin router.
*Rejected:* the earlier "ephemeral/stateless subagents" assumption.
*Evidence:* current harness Agent/SendMessage capability; user confirmation. (A research agent repeated
the stale "stateless" claim — flagged and overridden.)

## D5 — Six-space decomposition **[DECIDED]**
Orchestrator / Agents / Website / Checkpoints / Shared disk state / Knowledge structure. Shared state
added (5th) as the connective tissue for local-only comms; Knowledge added (6th) at user's request.
*Evidence:* planning conversation.

## D6 — Open-question-resolution pattern **[DECIDED]**
planning → up to orchestrator → Investigation → Arbiter → back down; keeps the orchestrator clean.
"Arbiter" chosen over the placeholder "sequential decision maker."
*Evidence:* user's described flow.

## D7 — Operating scope: single local project / user / machine **[DECIDED]** (A1)

## D8 — Human-in-the-loop: two modes + checkpoints **[DECIDED]** (B1)
Inception (heavy) + Steering (ongoing) + in-flight checkpoints.

## D9 — Concurrency: parallel by default, serialize on collision **[DECIDED]** (B2)
→ collision model needed.

## D10 — Session lifecycle + graceful handoff **[DECIDED]** (B3)
Start command boots orchestrator + website; finite context → graceful handoff (park → document →
commit → write `handoff.md`). Reset is now definitively understood:
- Pure config **cannot** self-`/clear`/restart (`/clear` is human-only; no hook/MCP/setting; `/compact`
  + delegation ceiling ~300–500 turns / ~2–4 hrs).
- **MVP path:** website prompts human to `/clear` + restart from `handoff.md` (one click).
- **Full-autonomy path (optional, deferred):** a thin local SDK runner triggers handoff + restart with
  no human action — the only path to true overnight autonomy.
- Correction to earlier framing: the runner does **not** break the master rule. The rule bans routing
  *others'* Claude via a hosted service; a locally-run runner on the user's own auth (even if published,
  each user runs their own) is ordinary individual use. Tradeoff is purity, not legality. Caveat: verify
  SDK subscription-vs-API-key auth when building it.
*Evidence:* B3 research, definitive, doc-cited.

## D11 — No fixed dogfood target **[DECIDED]** (C1)
General design from cross-project use, not built around one project. *Evidence:* user.

## D12 — Comms: local HTTP loopback bus **[DECIDED]** (A3)
Bus = website's local backend; `state.json` for the viewer; checkpoints = explicit wait-on-bus steps.
File-watching rejected for control-flow.
*Evidence:* A3 research (native-primitive + general-IPC angles).

## D13 — Knowledge format: OKF-adapted + LLM-Wiki pattern + llms.txt manifest **[DECIDED]** (D1)
`.knowledge/` dir; per-file nodes; typed edges with `why`; `# Sessions` log; `graph.json`; steal
Aider's tree-sitter extraction for structural edges. Maintenance model deferred.
*Evidence:* D1 research + prior art (Aider repomap, Code Property Graph).

## D14 — MVP scope line **[DECIDED]**
*In:* loop, persistent agents, website, manual checkpoints + help, knowledge base, graceful handoff.
*Out (designed-for):* automated testing, test-from-anywhere, paid device/QA platform.

## D15 — Spec-only; exported to a clean folder **[DONE]**
No implementation during planning. The spec was written in the planning chat, then moved to its
permanent home (`dev-autonomous-workflow/`) — now the source of truth, edited directly. *Evidence:* user.

## Intake stage (session 2026-06-29; full detail in `09`)

## D16 — One spine, variable-depth intake **[DECIDED]**
The two work-loops (existing project / new project) converge on a single autonomous execution spine; the
only variable is intake depth (bug → shallow, feature → short, inception → deep). Inception's output is a
backlog → Roadmap sequences it → steady-state spine; Steering injects new items into the same backlog.
*Rejected:* modeling them as two independent loops. *Evidence:* this session; consistent with D8. → `09`.

## D17 — Definition-of-done is the autonomy gate **[DECIDED]**
Every task carries testable acceptance criteria; that (not the task type) is what makes it safe to run
unattended and gives checkpoints + test/audit something to verify against. *Evidence:* this session. → `09`.

## D18 — Three intake types + contracts **[DECIDED]**
Bug / feature / project, each with a distinct intake contract = what the user must supply before the work
goes autonomous. *Evidence:* user's task taxonomy. → `09`.

## D19 — Bug intake contract **[DECIDED]**
Autonomous-found = already reproducible → fully autonomous fix; user-reported = explained-until-reproducible
OR full-flow (the latter ends with a user-verify checkpoint); non-reproducible-after-explanation → guided
diagnosis WITH the user, never blind fix-then-verify. A fix's DoD includes a regression test. "Can replicate
≠ knows what's correct" → autonomous fixing needs recorded intent (Space 6).
*Rejected:* "reproducible ⇒ safe to autonomously fix" as sufficient. *Evidence:* user + this session. → `09`.

## D20 — Required inception fields incl. audience + runtime **[DECIDED]**
Inception must capture tech stack, screens, purpose, features, **plus audience (who) and runtime/environment
(where)** — the product-side framing of engineering constraints — and data model + integrations. Output =
vision + spec + prioritized backlog. Audience/runtime feed an engineering-feasibility capability ("engineer
agent" — role real, exact agent OPEN). *Evidence:* user. → `09`, `02`.

## D21 — Demo/sandbox = throwaway product-alignment checkpoint **[DECIDED]**
A "create demo" skill emits a throwaway, minimal, non-integrated sandbox surfaced as a checkpoint;
feature-demo and project-demo are one primitive at two scales. It de-risks the *product* question only
(certifies the visual/behavioral subset of the spec), NOT engineering. Spec-first / demo-validates: the demo
is generated from the spec, change requests edit the spec and regenerate it (refine loop), and the spec state
behind the approved demo is what gets locked. Throwaway by default (no reuse as the real scaffold). Fidelity
matches the question (low-fi first).
*Rejected:* demo as the spec's producer; demo as design/engineering validation; reusing the sandbox as
scaffold. *Evidence:* user + this session. → `09`.

## D22 — The sandbox gate **[DECIDED]**
Sandbox iff (①) it's an open product decision the user owns, (②) it changes a user-visible surface, and (③)
the look/behavior is underdetermined (new pattern w/o precedent OR two materially-different valid builds).
Default = no sandbox; a genuine fence at ③ → a one-line ask. System-discovered work is never sandboxed
(escalated as steering instead). *Evidence:* user examples (A/B) + this session. → `09`.

## D23 — Three-state commitment model **[DECIDED]**
Every spec element is locked / provisional / unspecified, which dictates how a later deviation is treated:
locked → bug/drift; provisional → expected (and spawns a finalize-later backlog item — tracked debt);
unspecified → undefined behaviour → steering question, unless it hits a universal invariant
(crash / data-loss / security / broken core flow) → bug. Status defaults by fidelity + category, overridable.
Provisional changes must not trip the Space 6 drift check.
*Rejected:* monolithic demo approval; treating every demo detail as locked. *Evidence:* user's
locked-vs-change-later distinction + edge-case=undefined agreement. → `09`, `06`.

## Roster → package (session 2026-06-29; map in `10`, contracts in the package files)

## D24 — Capability roster v1 + skill/agent taxonomy + adjudicate base **[DECIDED]**
Derived by walking a full new-project loop end-to-end. 16 capabilities, each with an I/O contract (its
package file) over shared artifact schemas (`shared/schemas.md`); loop order + call-graph pinned (`10`).
- **skill** = procedure/controller (the *how*); **agent** = context-heavy persistent worker (D4).
  Controllers dispatch workers (e.g. `debug` the skill fans out mapping + `research` agents).
- **adjudicate** = one base skill (gather views → judge → confidence-gate → loop/escalate), specialized by
  `verify` / `debug` / `decision-engineer` — the Investigation→Arbiter pattern (D6) reified; collapses the
  prior Arbiter / engineer-agent / decision-engineer overlap into one adjudicator.
- `refine` routes corrections back through `planner`→`execute` (never fixes directly — preserves execute's
  zero-decision invariant); `verify` (artifacts) vs `debug` (runtime) split by object; one `checkpoint`
  gate behind demo/qa/setup; `planner` has decompose + plan-one modes; `document` ingests the
  decision/event stream, not just the changelog.
*Closes the `02` roster open item.* *Rejected:* a flat capability list with overlapping deciders; `refine`
as a second executor. *Evidence:* the dry-run walkthrough + user confirmation. → `10`, `02`.

## D25 — Package layout = Claude-Code-native plugin source **[DECIDED]**
The distributable is a CC-native plugin: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `agents/<name>.md`, `shared/schemas.md`
at the repo root (later `commands/`, `hooks/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). The repo is now
both the spec (`00`–`10`) and the package source. *Evidence:* user ("the Claude Code native default").
→ `10`, `05`.

## D26 — Interrupt model: pure queue **[DECIDED]**
The scheduler never self-preempts. In-flight work always runs to its item boundary, then `prioritize`
re-picks; ordering is urgency × dependency-readiness. Rationale: a critical bug found mid-execution is the
current item's own `verify→debug→refine` loop, not a competing backlog item, so preemption never applies;
a genuinely external emergency is handled by the human's manual override (steering), not by the machine.
This removes all parking / mini-handoff / anti-thrash machinery from `prioritize`.
*Rejected:* always-preempt (thrash); tiered-preempt-on-universal-invariants (over-engineered for MVP —
revisit only if the deferred overnight-autonomy runner makes the bounded wait unacceptable).
*Evidence:* user. → `10`, `09`.

## D27 — Agent topology: agents are leaf workers; adjudicators are skills **[DECIDED]**
**skill** = controller/procedure, run by the orchestrator, may dispatch agents. **agent** = a leaf worker
with its own tools that never spawns sub-agents. Consequences: the only agents are `research` and
`setup-guide`; all adjudicators (`verify`, `debug`, `decision-engineer`) are skills — so `decision-engineer`
is reclassified skill (was agent in the first roster draft). *Closes the `02` topology open question:*
strict hub-and-spoke, agents don't spawn agents. *Evidence:* surfaced writing the package files; user-flagged.
→ `10`, `02`.

## D28 — `init` / bootstrap capability **[DECIDED in principle]**
The workflow's start command (D10) is a capability `init` with two modes: **greenfield** (repo-setup →
scaffold workflow structure → launch console → hand to `discuss`) and **brownfield/integrate** (the above
plus an **ingest** pass that builds the initial Space-6 knowledge base + reconstructed spec from existing
code — "map to our standard"). `repo-setup` folds in as a step; `gh auth` and similar are `checkpoint`
(kind=setup) walkthroughs. Brownfield ingest depends on the still-open knowledge-ingest mechanics (`06`).
*Evidence:* user. → `10`, `01`, `06`.
